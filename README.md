# Coding Challenge 2

Cohort 3

## Overview

Now that you have finished the first challenge, it is time to see what you are really made of. The goal here is to refactor your current application to leverage state management and new React design patterns.

## Challenge - Intermediate

1. Refactor your code to use [Redux with Hooks](https://react-redux.js.org/next/api/hooks) to manage the state of your application.
   a. If you are unfamiliar with either redux or hooks, take the time to review the resources below.

## Requirements

- Create a new feature branch off of your master branch
- The branch name should match the following pattern

  - feature-{Your Name}-{feature being added}
  - For example: feature-uche-add-redux

- The flow of your application should be as follows:
  - Clicking on the submit button triggers an Action
  - The Action should be picked up by the Reducer
  - The Reducer should update the redux state with the user details
  - Then the user table should update with the current user details coming from the redux store.
    - Hint - use a Selector
- Use the same component library as in your original application
- Deploy your feature branch
- Attention: make sure to enable Redux Devtools when creating your store
